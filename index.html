    <h1>Villa Sirena</h1>
    <p>Villa Sirena is a Mexican style villa located in El Pueblo, a small
      gated community with approximately 20 homes. Located about 10
      minutes from Kralendijk on the North end of the island. All the
      homes have a stunning view of the Ocean with western exposure
      revealing beautiful sunsets.

      and the 3rd bedroom has a queen size bed. Each bedroom has
